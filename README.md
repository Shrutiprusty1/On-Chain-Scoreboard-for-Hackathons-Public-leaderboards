# 🏆 On-Chain Scoreboard for Hackathons

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple Clarity smart contract for maintaining a public, tamper-proof leaderboard for hackathon participants. Each participant has a score associated with their Stacks address, allowing transparent evaluation and ranking directly on-chain.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To enable decentralized and trustless scoring systems for hackathons or coding competitions, where all data is immutable and transparent on the blockchain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add ranking logic to return top N participants
- Introduce organizer roles with advanced permissions
- Add time-bound score submissions (e.g., deadlines)
- Enable NFT rewards for top performers
- Integrate with off-chain frontend apps for real-time display

## 🔐 Contract Address
The contract must be deployed using Clarity-compatible tools (like [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) or directly on the Stacks blockchain). Once deployed, the contract address will be available here.
